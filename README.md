# FCC Advanced Algorithms Tests

## What?

These are tests for the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) Advanced
Algorithm challenges (as of Nov 15, 2016), implemented in Mocha and Chai.

## Why?

A few reasons, really. I don't like working in web-based editors, for reasons.
I also wanted to learn how to write and use tests for the sake of completing the front end challenges, and this seemed more fun than following a tutorial. Finally, I felt like a change of pace so I took one.

## How?

1. Clone this repository.
1. `$ npm install`
1. Start solving problems.
1. When you want to test: `$ npm test`

Get more help on [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](http://chaijs.com).
